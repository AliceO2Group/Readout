# Readout configuration parameters reference

## Sections
The readout configuration is split in different sections. Some sections have a unique instance (single name), some may have multiple instances (prefix-[instance name], shown as prefix-\* in this document).

The *readout* section defines global parameters.
The *bank-\** section defines parameters for the memory banks.
The *equipment-\** section defines parameters for the readout equipments.
The *consumer-\** section defines parameters for the readout data consumers.
The *receiverFMQ-\** section defines parameters for the test receiverFMQ.exe program, and usually kept at the same place as readout parameters for coherency.

Please see the provided example configuration files to see how they are usually arranged.

## Parameter types

The following table describes the types used in the configuration, giving:
- Name: the name by which this type is referenced in this documentation.
- Input: the type necessary to store the input value in the configuration system.
- Output: the type used in readout, to make use of the value.
- Notes: extra information on the type and conversion process, if applicable.

| Name| Input | Output | Notes |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| int | int | int | |
| double | double | double | |
| string | string | string | |
| bytes | string | long long | Input string is converted to a 64-bit integer value allowing usual "base units" in the suffix (k,M,G,T), as powers of 1024. Input can be decimal (1.5M is valid, will give 1.5\*1024\*1024). |

## Parameters description

Parameters without a default value are usually mandatory in the corresponding section.
Some parameters may be set for all instances of a given section [sectionName-\*], some may apply only to the instances of a given type [sectionName-type-\*].
The parameters related to 3rd-party libraries are described here for convenience, but should be further checked in the corresponding source documentation. In particular, please refer to:

- the Monitoring library documentation for some of the consumer-stats device parameters: https://github.com/AliceO2Group/Monitoring
- the FairMQ library documentation for some of the consumer-FMQchannel device parameters: https://github.com/FairRootGroup/FairMQ
