# Readout configuration parameters reference

## Sections
The readout configuration is splitted in different sections. Some sections have a unique instance (single name), some may have multiple instances (prefix-[instance name], shown as prefix-\* in this document).

The *readout* section defines global parameters.
The *bank-\** section defines parameters for the memory banks.
The *equipment-\** section defines parameters for the readout equipments.
The *consumer-\** section defines parameters for the readout data consumers.
The *receiverFMQ-\** section defines parameters for the test receiverFMQ.exe program, and usually kept at the same place as readout parameters for coherency.

## Parameter types

The following table describes the types used in the configuration, giving:
- Name: the name by which this type is referenced in this documentation.
- Input: the type necessary to store the input value in the configuration system.
- Output: the type used in readout, to make use of the value.
- Notes: extra information on the type and conversion process, if applicable.

| Name| Input | Output | Notes |
| -- | -- | -- | -- |
| int | int | int | |
| double | double | double | |
| string | string | string | |
| bytes | string | long long | Input string is converted to a 64-bit integer value allowing usual "base units" in the suffix (k,M,G,T), as powers of 1024. Input can be decimal (1.5M is valid, will give 1.5\*1024\*1024). |

## Parameters description

Parameters without a default value are usually mandatory in the corresponding section.
Some parameters may be set for all instances of a given section [sectionName-\*], some may apply only to the instances of a given type [sectionName-type-\*].
The parameters related to 3rd-party libraries are described here for convenience, but should be further checked in the corresponding source documentation. In particular, please refer to:
- the ReadoutCard library documentation for some of the equipment-rorc devices parameters: https://github.com/AliceO2Group/ReadoutCard
- the Monitoring library documentation for some of the consumer-stats device parameters: https://github.com/AliceO2Group/Monitoring
- the FairMQ library documentation for some of the consumer-FMQchannel device parameters: https://github.com/FairRootGroup/FairMQ
